# Recovery+ iOS App - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A React Native/Expo iOS app for injury and chronic pain recovery, featuring AI-powered coaching, structured recovery phases, and comprehensive exercise guidance.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native/Expo
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Server State**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **UI/Styling**: Shadcn + Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase
- **AI**: OpenAI ChatGPT API

## Priority 1: Exercise Detail System Enhancement

### Current Assessment
The exercise detail system has been implemented with basic functionality including:
- ✅ Exercise detail screen with video integration
- ✅ YouTube video search and embedding  
- ✅ Exercise session state management
- ✅ Premium feature gating for videos
- ✅ Basic exercise feedback collection

### Issues Found
1. **Type Inconsistency**: Two different Exercise interfaces exist (`ExerciseCard.tsx` vs `types/index.ts`)
2. **Missing Core Features**: No sets/reps/hold time tracking during exercise execution
3. **Limited Timer Functionality**: No built-in exercise timer for timed exercises
4. **Incomplete Session Tracking**: Session progress not tracked within individual exercises

### Enhancement Plan

#### Task 1: Unified Exercise Type System ✅
- [x] ~~Analyze current exercise type definitions~~
- [x] ~~Consolidate Exercise interfaces into single source of truth~~
- [x] ~~Add missing fields: sets, reps, holdTime, restTime, instructions array~~
- [x] ~~Update all components to use unified type~~

#### Task 2: Exercise Execution Tracking ✅
- [x] ~~Add sets/reps completion tracking within sessions~~
- [x] ~~Implement hold time tracking for isometric exercises~~
- [x] ~~Add rest timer between sets~~
- [x] ~~Track partial completion when exercises are paused/stopped~~

#### Task 3: Interactive Exercise Timer ✅
- [x] ~~Create countdown timer component for timed exercises~~
- [x] ~~Add set completion tracking with visual feedback~~
- [x] ~~Implement rest period timer with controls~~
- [x] ~~Add pause/resume functionality during exercise execution~~

#### Task 4: Enhanced Progress Visualization ✅
- [x] ~~Show current set/rep progress during exercise~~
- [x] ~~Add completion percentage for current exercise~~
- [x] ~~Display remaining time for timed exercises~~
- [x] ~~Visual progress indicators for each set completed~~

#### Task 5: Testing & Integration ✅
- [x] ~~Test unified types across all components~~
- [x] ~~Run linting and type checking~~
- [x] ~~Update exercise feedback to capture new tracking data~~
- [x] ~~Create exercise session execution screen with timer integration~~

**Completed Features:**

- ✅ Zustand store for message management
- ✅ User context tracking capabilities

### Issues Found
1. **Limited AI Integration**: Chat screen uses mock responses instead of OpenAI service
2. **No Exercise Recommendations**: AI can't suggest specific exercises from the app
3. **Missing Context Awareness**: Doesn't use user questionnaire data or exercise history
4. **No Exercise Actions**: Can't directly start workouts or view exercise details from chat

### Enhancement Plan

#### Task 1: OpenAI Integration ✅
- [x] ~~Review existing OpenAI service implementation~~
- [x] ~~Connect ChatScreen to use real OpenAI responses~~
- [x] ~~Add context-aware prompt engineering~~
- [x] ~~Implement conversation continuity~~

#### Task 2: Exercise-Aware AI ✅
- [x] ~~Create exercise database query integration~~
- [x] ~~Add AI ability to recommend specific exercises~~
- [x] ~~Implement exercise preview cards in chat~~
- [x] ~~Add "Start Exercise" action buttons~~

#### Task 3: Context-Driven Responses ✅
- [x] ~~Integrate user questionnaire data into AI context~~
- [x] ~~Use exercise history for personalized recommendations~~
- [x] ~~Add pain/feedback tracking context~~
- [x] ~~Implement recovery phase awareness~~

#### Task 4: Enhanced Chat UI ✅
- [x] ~~Add exercise suggestion cards~~
- [x] ~~Implement action buttons (Start Exercise, View Details)~~
- [x] ~~Add quick response suggestions~~
- [x] ~~Improve conversation flow with structured responses~~

#### Task 5: Integration & Testing ✅
- [x] ~~Test with real OpenAI integration~~
- [x] ~~Verify exercise recommendations accuracy~~
- [x] ~~Test conversation context persistence~~
- [x] ~~Ensure smooth integration with exercise system~~

**Completed Features:**
- **Enhanced Chat Service**: Real OpenAI integration with context-aware prompts
- **Exercise Recommendation Cards**: Beautiful UI cards with exercise details and actions
- **Quick Reply System**: Smart suggestion buttons for better conversation flow
- **Exercise Actions**: Direct "Start Exercise" and "View Details" functionality from chat
- **Context Integration**: Uses exercise history, pain levels, and recovery phase data
- **Fallback System**: Rule-based responses when AI service is unavailable

### Expected Outcome
An intelligent AI fitness coach that provides:
- Personalized exercise recommendations based on user profile
- Context-aware responses using questionnaire and exercise history
- Direct integration with exercise execution system
- Smart conversation flow with actionable suggestions
