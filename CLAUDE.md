1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to projectplan.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
If an error doesn't get resolved by the 2nd time, take extra time to thoroughly go through and find the root problem.  Don't assume anything.
after every step is done, run npm run lint to check for bugs before confirming everything is done.  
if completed a task in @projectplan.md cross it off as a task so we can keep track of everything done
if fixing an error, make sure to thoroughly run the issue and make sure the error is actually solved
